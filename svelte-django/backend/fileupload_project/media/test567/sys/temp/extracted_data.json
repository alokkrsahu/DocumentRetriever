This means that where you are joining a group of organisations, including\njoint ventures and partnerships, each organisation in that group must complete one of\nthese self-declarations.

If you are bidding on behalf of a\ngroup/consortium or you intend to use subcontractors, you should complete all of the\nselection questions on behalf of the group/consortium and/or any subcontractors.\nIf the relevant documentary evidence referred to in the Selection Questionnaire is not\nprovided upon request and without delay, we reserve the right to exclude you from the\nprocurement process, including where an award decision has already been notified, and\naward to another supplier.\nConsequences of misrepresentation\nIf you seriously misrepresent any factual information in filling in the Selection\nQuestionnaire, and so induce an authority to enter into a contract, there may be significant\nconsequences.

The “authority” means the contracting authority, or anyone acting on behalf of the\ncontracting authority, that is seeking to invite suitable candidates to participate in this\nprocurement process.\n2. “You” / “Your” refers to the potential supplier completing this standard Selection\nQuestionnaire i.e. the legal entity responsible for the information provided. The term\n“potential supplier” is intended to cover any economic operator as defined by the Public\nContracts Regulations 2015 (referred to as the “regulations”) and could be a registered\ncompany; the lead contact for a group of economic operators; charitable organisation;\nVoluntary Community and Social Enterprise (VCSE); Special Purpose Vehicle; or other\nform of entity.\n3. Please ensure that all questions are completed in full, and in the format requested.\nIf the question does not apply to you, please state ‘N/A’. Should you need to provide\nadditional information in response to the questions, please submit a clearly identified\nannex.\n4. The authority recognises that arrangements set out in section 1.2 of the standard\nSelection Questionnaire, in relation to a group of economic operators (for example, a\nconsortium) and/or use of subcontractors, may be subject to change and will, therefore,\nnot be finalised until a later date. The lead contact should notify the authority immediately\nof any change in the proposed arrangements and ensure a completed part 1 and part 2 is\nsubmitted for any new organisation relied on to meet the selection criteria. The authority\nwill make a revised assessment of the submission based on the updated information.\n5. The authority may decline to consider bids (or otherwise exclude from\nparticipating in the procurement) from suppliers who are constituted or organised under\nthe law of Russia or Belarus, or whose ‘Persons of Significant Control’ information states\nRussia or Belarus as the place of residency, unless the supplier (or any member of their\nsupply chain they rely on to deliver the contract):\n• is registered in the UK or in a country the UK has a relevant international\nagreement with reciprocal rights of access to public procurement; and/or\n• has significant business operations in the UK or in a country the UK has a\nrelevant international agreement with reciprocal rights of access to public\nprocurement.\n6. For part 1 and part 2 every member of your bidding group/consortium, and any\nsubcontractor that is being relied on to meet the selection criteria, must complete and\nsubmit the self-declaration.\n7. For the mandatory exclusion grounds only (Q2.1(a)), you must complete the\ndeclaration for all relevant persons and entities. There are two categories of persons and\nentities:\n• members of your administrative, management or supervisory board;\n• entities and persons who have powers of representation, decision or control.\nYou must decide, depending on the nature and structure of the entity or person who is\nbidding, which entities and persons this applies to in your particular circumstances.\nClearly, members of your administrative, management or supervisory board should be\neasily identifiable and will cover company directors (or equivalent for other types of\ncorporate entities) and members of an executive board.\nThe second category of those with powers of representation, decision or control, is\nlikely to be more complicated. As an illustration, entities or persons with 25% or more\nshareholding (or equivalent for other types of corporate entities) are likely to have",
